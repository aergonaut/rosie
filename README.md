# rosie

**Rosie** helps keep your repository tidy by ensuring your contributors follow
a standard format for commit messages and Pull Request titles.

**Disclaimer**: Currently, Rosie is intended for use only by my coworkers and I
at my day job. Given that, the code is very opinionated and probably won't be
useful to you without some serious customization. YMMV.

## Features

- [ ] Check commit messages against a given regex
- [ ] Check PR titles against a given regex
- [ ] Warn of violations in a comment posted on the Pull Request
- [ ] Optionally add a failed status to the PR if standard is broken

## License
